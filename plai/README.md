## About the book

- **Author**: Shriram Krishnamurthi
- **First Published**: 2007 (continuously updated)
- **Website**: https://www.plai.org/

PLAI is a textbook on programming languages that takes an interpreter-based approach to understanding language features. Rather than studying languages from a user's perspective, it teaches how to implement language features from scratch.

## Topics covered

- Parsing and desugaring
- Interpreters and evaluators
- Functions and environments
- Mutation and state
- Objects and inheritance
- Type systems and type checking
- Continuations and control flow

## Language

All exercises are written in **Typed Plait**, a typed dialect of Racket designed for teaching programming languages.
